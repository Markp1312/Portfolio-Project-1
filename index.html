                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Hi, My name is Mark and I have created this webpage to introduce you to the beautifull town of Falcarragh in County Donegal.
                    I am originally from The Netherlands and moved to Ireland back in 2018 for work and love.
                    My girlfriend is Irish and she is from Falcarragh.
                    <hr>
                    We started to live together in the area at the start of the first lockdown.
                    During this time we did regular walks on the beach and were climbing some serious mountains.
                    The scenery and nature are in 1 word spectacular and it is one of the lesser known corners within The Republic of Ireland.
                    So I have decided to create this source of information so that you might be convinced to visit this beautifull County.

                <h3>Overview of the Area</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Falcarragh is located on the Wild Atlantic Way which is one of the biggest tourist destinations within Ireland.
                    There are stunning beaches in the area and one of the most famous beaches is locally known as Machaire Rabhartaigh in Gaeilge.
                    In English this does translate to magheroarty beach.
                    <hr>
                    There are many options for cycling in the area because the roads are well maintained and distance between villages along the Wild Atlantic Way is not too far.
                    The only challenge that you will find is that none of the roads is flat, 90% of the roads are going up or going down.
