                    Falcarragh railway station served the village of Falcarragh, 4km away, in County Donegal, Ireland.
                    The station opened on 9 March 1903 when the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway opened their
                    Letterkenny and Burtonport Extension Railway,
                    from Letterkenny to Burtonport. It closed on 3 June 1940 when the LLSR closed the line from Tooban
                    Junction to Burtonport in an effort to save money.
