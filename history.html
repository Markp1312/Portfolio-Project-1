                <h3>History of Falcarragh</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    The name Falcarragh (lit. An (the) Fál (Wall) Carrach (Stone), Stone Wall / Boundary) has been used
                    since 1850, ascribed so by O' Donavan as
                    he believed 'Na Crois Bhealaí', the Cross Roads, was too common in Ireland to allow distinction.
                    Na Crois Bhealaí is still used by native speakers when referring to the town.
                    On some maps it shows up as 'Crossroads' deriving from its Irish language name Na Croisbhealaí but
                    older maps refer to it as Robinson's Town,
                    but it is now listed as An Fál Carrach.
                    An Fál Carrach, the main commercial town between Letterkenny and Dungloe was known in former times
                    both as Crossroads and as Robinson’s Town.
                    An Fál Carrach, the official name, originally referred to a little hamlet south-east of the present
                    town, at the foot of Falcarragh hill
                    but gradually houses were built at the crossroads, mainly for the workers and tradespeople employed
                    on the Olphert Estate in Ballyconnell.

                <h3>Bridge of tears</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Prior to the introduction of railways and modern roads, the bridge was used on the main route to
                    Derry. The port at Derry was used by emigrants leaving to start a new life in countries such as
                    Australia, Canada, England, Scotland and the United States. The bridge was the spot that the
                    emigrants families would say goodbye.
                    Due to the cost of travel, and the unlikeliness that the emigrants would return, their leaving was
                    treated like a funeral
